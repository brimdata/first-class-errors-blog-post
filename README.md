This is the sample data and the completed zed scripts from the blog post _Easier Data Debugging with Zedâ€™s First-class Errors_.

Getting Started

1. First, [install](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/install) the zed and zq binaries.

2. Clone and cd into repository.

3. Start your zed lake server.

```
zed serve -lake ./lake
```

This starts a Zed lake and instructs it to store data in a folder called "lake" within this directory.

Now you can follow along and run the blog post code snippets in another terminal.
